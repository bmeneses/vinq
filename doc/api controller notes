the category api should run and get a comprehensive list of categories available
the controller should then query the catalog for each category
	* the controller should get each offset group before beginning a compare with the existing database

	* the controller should ask the api to sort descending by date so the newest items are received first

	* the controller should compare the products that it downloaded in the response hash and see if they're in the product database

	 * if it exists, don't add, then quit (as all remaining items already in the db)

	separate task (due to api constraints)
	* the controller should then walk through each individual products and query by product to get the professional ratings



update the category list
then ask how many the db has of each category (category key will be )
if it doesn't match, then update
