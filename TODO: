TODO:

Figure out why will_paginate only works with 30 items at a time despite setting WillPaginate.per_page

Module-ify common elments of models such as to_param, valid_url_format, etc. that make sense

Roadmap:
* Implement ProductAttribute filtering
* Implement recommendation model
	- Read about Recommendable gem
	- Extend user model
	- Create model for recommendation
